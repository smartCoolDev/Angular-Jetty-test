# Jetty-Angular-test
Thanks for kind attention for my test project.

## Frontend Server
Run `npm start` for a frontend server.

## Json-Server
Run `npm run mock:server` for a mock backend server.

## Requirements
- Make a request to a back-end server endpoint: $Employee_Endpoint and get an employee based on provided {employeeId}
  src/app/services/getEmployeeByID
- Make another request to endpoint: $Address_Endpoint and get employee's address also
- src/app/services/getAddressByID
 - combine both of the above requests and write a component: MyAccount to display the combined information in a page on the component like below:
   <combinedInfo>
   <>combinedInfo.firstName</>
   <>combinedInfo.lastName</>
   <>combinedInfo.streetAddress</>
   </>
I implemented this one using forkJoin in both search-result component and card-list component's handleMouseOver event handling.
- Also if an error occurs display the error message in a separate component: ErrorComponent like:
 <>Your request could not be processed, please try again later</>
To do this, I used ErrorHttpInterceptor and ErrorService.
- Before making the requests to $Employee_Endpoint or $Address_Endpoint make sure you add jwt token that is 
generated by endpoint: $Auth_Endpoint
I managed this part by creating TokenInterceptor.
